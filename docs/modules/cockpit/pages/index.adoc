= Stackable Cockpit

IMPORTANT: The Stackable Cockpit is currently an early preview, and is not yet a fully supported component of the
Stackable Data Platform.

The `Cockpit` application is a browser-based management tool which interacts with the Stackable data platform. Currently
it can display deployed stacklets and their status. The display can be compared with the
xref:management:stackablectl:commands/stacklet.adoc#list-stacklets[`stackablectl stacklet list`] command output.

The installation is described in the xref:installation.adoc[installation guide].
