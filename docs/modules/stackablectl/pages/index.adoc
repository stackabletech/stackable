The `stackablectl` command line tool interacts with the Stackable data platform. It can install individual
operators as well as platform releases. It also ships with a set of pre-built xref:commands/demo.adoc[`demos`] that
utilize different data products of the Platform, e.g. an end-to-end data pipeline.

The installation of `stackablectl` is described in xref:installation.adoc[installation guide]. To get started, please
follow the xref:quickstart.adoc[quickstart guide].

In general, use `stackablectl --help` to find out more about how to use the tool or specific options. Every subcommand
supports the help flag. For example, `stackablectl release install --help` will show the usage test for installing a
release. You can also use an abbreviation instead of typing out the complete commands. E.g. `stackablectl operator list`
can also be written as `stackablectl op ls`

A Kubernetes cluster is required to use the Stackable Data Platform, as all products and operators run on Kubernetes. If
you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] Kubernetes Cluster for
you.

The deployed services are separated into three different layers, as illustrated below:

== Operators

This layer consists of Stackable operators managing the individual data products. They can be installed one by one with
the xref:commands/operator.adoc[`operator`] command or from a release with the xref:commands/release.adoc[`release`]
command, which is recommended. A release is a well-playing bundle of operators that Stackable has extensively tested.

== Stacks

A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products and required third-party services like Postgresql or
MinIO.

Stacks are installed with the xref:commands/stack.adoc[`stack`] command. A stack needs a release (of Stackable
operators) to run on. That's why a stack depends on a release, which gets automatically installed when a stack is
installed.

== Demos

A demo is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform. It contains:

. Installing a Stackable release
. Spinning up a stack
. Performing the actual demo
.. Prepare some test data
.. Process test data
.. Visualize results (optional)

Demos are installed with the xref:commands/demo.adoc[`demo`] command. A demo needs a stack to run on. That's why a demo
depends on a stack, which gets automatically installed when a demo is installed. The stack, in turn, will install the
needed Stackable release.

You can browse the available demos on the xref:home:demos:index.adoc[demo] page.
