[CAUTION]
====
This demo only runs in the `default` namespace, as a `ServiceAccount` will be created. Additionally, we have to use the
FQDN service names (including the namespace), so that the used TLS certificates are valid.
====

This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators.
* Spin up the following data products:
** *Superset*: A modern data exploration and visualization platform. This demo utilizes Superset to retrieve data from
   Druid via SQL queries and build dashboards on top of that data
** *Kafka*:  A distributed event streaming platform for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics and data
   integration. This demo uses it as an event streaming platform to stream the data in near real-time.
** *NiFi*:  An easy-to-use, robust system to process and distribute data. This demo uses it to fetch earthquake data
   from the internet and ingest it into Kafka.
** *Druid*: A real-time database to power modern analytics applications. This demo uses it to ingest the near real-time
   data from Kafka, store it and enable access to the data via SQL.
** *MinIO*: A S3 compatible object store. This demo uses it as persistent storage for Druid to store all the data.
* Continuously emit approximately 10,000 records/s of https://earthquake.usgs.gov/[earthquake data] into Kafka.
* Start a Druid ingestion job that ingests the data into the Druid instance.
* Create Superset dashboards for visualization of the data.

The whole data pipeline will have a very low latency, from putting a record into Kafka to showing up in the dashboard
charts. You can see the deployed products and their relationship in the following diagram:

== Inspecting Data in Kafka

Kafka is an event streaming platform to stream the data in near real-time. All the messages put in and read from Kafka
are structured in dedicated queues called topics. The test data will be put into a topic called earthquakes. The records
are produced (put in) by the test data generator and consumed (read) by Druid afterwards in the same order they were
created.

As Kafka has no web interface, you must use a Kafka client like h{kcat}[kafkacat]. Kafka uses mutual TLS, so clients
wanting to connect to Kafka must present a valid TLS certificate. The easiest way to obtain this is to shell into the
`kafka-broker-default-0` Pod, as we will do in the following section for demonstration purposes. For a production setup,
you should spin up a dedicated Pod provisioned with a certificate acting as a Kafka client instead of shell-ing into the
Kafka Pod.

=== Listing Available Topics

You can execute a command on the Kafka broker to list the available topics as follows:

[source,console]
----
kubectl exec -it kafka-broker-default-0 -c kafka -- /bin/bash -c "/stackable/kcat -b localhost:9093 -X security.protocol=SSL -X ssl.key.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.key -X ssl.certificate.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.crt -X ssl.ca.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/ca.crt -L"
Metadata for all topics (from broker -1: ssl://localhost:9093/bootstrap):
 1 brokers:
  broker 1001 at 172.18.0.2:32175 (controller)
 1 topics:
  topic "earthquakes" with 8 partitions:
    partition 0, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 1, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 2, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 3, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 4, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 5, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 6, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
    partition 7, leader 1001, replicas: 1001, isrs: 1001
----

You can see that Kafka consists of one broker, and the topic `earthquakes` with eight partitions has been created. To
see some records sent to Kafka, run the following command. You can change the number of records to print via the `-c`
parameter.

// Choosing json over console here, because most part is json and it improves syntax highlighting
[source,json]
----
kubectl exec -it kafka-broker-default-0 -c kafka -- /bin/bash -c "/stackable/kcat -b localhost:9093 -X security.protocol=SSL -X ssl.key.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.key -X ssl.certificate.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.crt -X ssl.ca.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/ca.crt -C -t earthquakes -c 1"

----

If you are interested in how many records have been produced to the Kafka topic so far, use the following command. It
will print the last record produced to the topic partition, formatted with the pattern specified in the `-f` parameter.
The given pattern will print some metadata of the record.

[source,console]
----
$ kubectl exec -it kafka-broker-default-0 -c kafka -- /bin/bash -c "/stackable/kcat -b localhost:9093 -X security.protocol=SSL -X ssl.key.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.key -X ssl.certificate.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/tls.crt -X ssl.ca.location=/stackable/tls_server_mount/ca.crt -C -t earthquakes -o -8 -c 8 -f 'Topic %t / Partition %p / Offset: %o / Timestamp: %T\n'"
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385011 / Timestamp: 1680607795568
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385012 / Timestamp: 1680607795568
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385013 / Timestamp: 1680607795570
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385014 / Timestamp: 1680607795570
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385015 / Timestamp: 1680607795571
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385016 / Timestamp: 1680607795571
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385017 / Timestamp: 1680607795571
Topic earthquakes / Partition 0 / Offset: 385018 / Timestamp: 1680607795571
----

If you calculate `385,011` records * `8` partitions, you end up with ~ 3,080,088 records. The output also shows that the
last measurement record was produced at the timestamp `1680607795568`, which translates to `Di 4. Apr 13:29:55 CEST 2023`
(using the command `date -d @1680607795`).

== NiFi

NiFi is used to fetch earthquake data from the internet and ingest it into Kafka. This demo includes a workflow
("process group") that downloads a large CSV file, converts it to individual JSON records and produces the records into
Kafka.

=== Viewing testdata-generation Job

You can have a look at the ingestion job running in NiFi by opening the endpoint `https` from your
`stackablectl stacklets list` command output. In this case, it is https://172.18.0.3:32558. Open it with your favourite
browser. Suppose you get a warning regarding the self-signed certificate generated by the
xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[Secret Operator] (e.g. Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead). In that case, you must
tell your browser to trust the website and continue.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/nifi_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/nifi_2.png[]

You can see the started ProcessGroup consisting of two processors. The first one - `InvokeHTTP`, fetches the CSV file
from the Internet and puts it into the queue of the next processor. The second processor - `PublishKafkaRecord_2_6`,
parses the CSV file, converts it to JSON records and writes them out into Kafka.

Double-click on the `InvokeHTTP` processor to show the processor details.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/nifi_3.png[]

Head over to the Tab `PROPERTIES`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/nifi_4.png[]

Here, you can see the setting `Remote URl`, which specifies the download URL from where the CSV file is retrieved. Close
the processor details popup by clicking `OK`. Afterwards, double-click on the processor `PublishKafkaRecord_2_6`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/nifi_5.png[]

The Kafka connection details within this processor - like broker addresses and topic names - are specified. It uses the
`CSVReader` to parse the downloaded CSV and the `JsonRecordSetWriter` to split it into individual JSON records before
writing it out.

== Druid

Druid is used to ingest the near real-time data from Kafka, store it and enable SQL access. The demo has started an
ingestion job reading earthquake records from the Kafka topic earthquakes and saving them into Druid's deep storage. The
Druid deep storage is based on the S3 store provided by MinIO.

=== Viewing Ingestion Job

You can have a look at the ingestion job running in Druid by opening the endpoint `router-http` from your
`stackablectl stacklets list` command output (http://172.18.0.4:30109 in this case).

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_1.png[]

By clicking on `Ingestion` at the top, you can see the running ingestion jobs.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_2.png[]

You can see additional information after clicking on the magnification glass to the right side of the `RUNNING`
supervisor. On the tab `Statistics` on the left, you can see the number of processed records as well as the number of
errors.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_3.png[]

The statistics show that Druid is currently ingesting `1251` records/s and has ingested 2.1 million records already. All
entries have been consumed successfully, indicated by having no `processWithError`, `thrownAway` or `unparseable`
records.

=== Querying the Data Source

The ingestion job has automatically created the Druid data source `earthquakes`. You can see the available data sources
by clicking on `Datasources` at the top.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_4.png[]

You can see the data source's segments by clicking on the `earthquake` data source. In this case, the `earthquake` data
source is partitioned by the year of the earthquake, resulting in 73 segments.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_5.png[]

Druid offers a web-based way of querying the data sources via SQL. To achieve this, you must first click on `Query` at
the top.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_6.png[]

You can now enter any arbitrary SQL statement, to e.g. list 10 earthquakes runs

[source,sql]
----
select * from earthquakes limit 10
----

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_7.png[]

To count the number of earthquakes per year run

[source,sql]
----
select
  time_format(__time, 'YYYY') as "year",
  count(*) as earthquakes
from earthquakes
group by 1
order by 1 desc
----

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/druid_8.png[]

== Superset

Superset provides the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the endpoint `external-superset` in your
browser (http://172.18.0.3:32108 in this case).

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_2.png[]

=== Viewing Dashboard

The demo has created a Dashboard to visualize the earthquake data. To open it, click on the tab `Dashboards` at the top.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_3.png[]

Click on the dashboard called `Earthquakes`. It might take some time until the dashboards renders all included charts.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_4.png[]

=== Viewing Charts

The dashboard `Earthquakes` consists of multiple charts. To list the charts, click on the tab `Charts` at the top.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_5.png[]

Click on the Chart `Number of earthquakes my magnitude`. On the left side you can modify the chart and click on `Run` to
see the effect.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_6.png[]

=== Viewing the Earthquake Distribution on the World Map

To look at the geographical distribution of the earthquakes you have to click on the tab `Charts` at the top again.
Afterwards click on the chart `Earthquake distribution`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_7.png[]

The distribution of the earthquakes matches the continental plate margins. This is the expected distribution from the
{wikipedia}[Wikipedia article on Earthquakes].

You can move and zoom the map with your mouse to interactively explore the map. You can e.g. have a detailed look at the
detected earthquakes in Germany.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_8.png[]

You can also click on the magnitudes in the legend on the top right side to enable/disable printing the earthquakes of
that magnitude. By only enabling magnitudes greater or equal to 8 you can plot only the most severe earthquakes.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_9.png[]

=== Executing Arbitrary SQL Statements

Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements. On the top click on the tab
`SQL Lab` -> `SQL Editor`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_10.png[]

On the left select the database `druid`, the schema `druid` and set `See table schema` to `earthquakes`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_11.png[]

On the right textbox enter the desired SQL statement. If you do not want to make one up, you can use the following:

[source,sql]
----
select
  time_format(__time, 'YYYY') as "year",
  count(*) as earthquakes
from earthquakes
group by 1
order by 1 desc
----

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/superset_12.png[]

== MinIO

The S3 provided by MinIO is used as a persistent deep storage for Druid to store all the data used. Open the `minio`
endpoint `console-http` in your browser (http://172.18.0.4:31664 in this case).

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/minio_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/minio_2.png[]

Click on the blue button `Browse` on the bucket `druid` and open the folders `data` -> `earthquakes`.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/minio_3.png[]

As you can see druid saved 199MB of data within 73 prefixes (folders). One prefix corresponds to on segment which in
turn contains all the data of a year. If you don't see any folders or files, the reason is that Druid has not saved its
data from memory to the deep storage yet. After waiting a few minutes, the data should have been flushed to S3 and
show up.

image::demos/nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data/minio_4.png[]

If you open up a prefix for a specific year you can see that Druid has placed a file containing the data of that year
there.

== Summary

The demo streamed 10,000 earthquake records/s for a total of ~3 million earthquakes into a Kafka steaming pipeline.
Druid ingested the data near real-time into its data source and enabled SQL access to it. Superset was used as a
web-based frontend to execute SQL statements and build dashboards.

== Where to go from here

There are multiple paths to go from here. The following sections give you some ideas on what to explore next. You can
find the description of the earthquake data {earthquake}[on the United States Geological Survey website].

=== Executing Arbitrary SQL Statements

Within Superset (or the Druid web interface), you can execute arbitrary SQL statements to explore the earthquake data.

=== Creating Additional Dashboards

You also can create additional charts and bundle them together in a Dashboard. Have a look at
{superset-docs}[the Superset documentation] on how to do that.

=== Loading Additional Data

You can use the NiFi web interface to collect arbitrary data and write it to Kafka (it's recommended to use new Kafka
topics for that). Alternatively, you can use a Kafka client like {kcat}[kafkacat] to create new topics and ingest data.
Using the Druid web interface, you can start an ingestion job that consumes and stores the data in an internal data
source. There is an excellent {druid-tutorial}[tutorial] from Druid on how to do this. Afterwards, the data source can
be analyzed within Druid and Superset, like the earthquake data.
