:page-aliases: stackablectl::quickstart.adoc

In this Quickstart guide, you will install a xref:commands/demo.adoc[demo], which is an end-to-end demonstration of the
usage of the Stackable data platform. Please follow the xref:installation.adoc[Installation documentation] to install
the `stackablectl` tool.

== Browse Available Demos

Stackable provides a set of ready-to-use demos. They will automatically appear as `stackablectl` fetches the available
list of demos via the internet. To list the available demos, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo list

[NOTE]
====
When you are on a Windows system you have to replace the `stackablectl` command with `stackablectl.exe`, e.g.
`stackablectl.exe demo list`. This applies to all commands below.
====

For this guide, we will use the xref:demos:trino-taxi-data.adoc[] demo. The installation of other available demos
should work the same way. You need to use the name of the chosen demo instead of `trino-taxi-data` in the following
commands.

== Install Demo

The installation depends on whether you already have a Kubernetes cluster to run the Stackable Data Platform.

=== Using Existing Kubernetes Cluster

If you want to access a Kubernetes cluster, make sure your https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl[`kubectl`]
Kubernetes client is configured to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. After that, run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data
The release commons-operator was successfully installed.
The release hive-operator was successfully installed.
The release opa-operator was successfully installed.
The release secret-operator was successfully installed.
The release superset-operator was successfully installed.
The release trino-operator was successfully installed.
Installed demo trino-taxi-data

Use "stackablectl operator installed" to display the installed operators
Use "stackablectl stacklet list" to display the installed stacklets
----

=== Using Local Kind Cluster

If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind]
Kubernetes cluster for you. Make sure you have `kind` installed and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data -c kind
Creating cluster "stackable-data-platform" ...
 ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.26.3) 🖼
 ✓ Preparing nodes 📦 📦
 ✓ Writing configuration 📜
 ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
 ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
 ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
 ✓ Joining worker nodes 🚜
Set kubectl context to "kind-stackable-data-platform"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-stackable-data-platform

The release commons-operator was successfully installed.
The release hive-operator was successfully installed.
The release opa-operator was successfully installed.
The release secret-operator was successfully installed.
The release superset-operator was successfully installed.
The release trino-operator was successfully installed.
Installed demo trino-taxi-data

Use "stackablectl operator installed" to display the installed operators
Use "stackablectl stacklet list" to display the installed stacklets
----

The demos create Kubernetes jobs that will populate test data and talk to the installed products to process the data.
Until the products are ready, the pods of these jobs are expected to fail with an error. They will get retried with an
exponentially growing backoff time. After the products are ready, they should turn green, and everything should settle
down.

== Proceed with the Demo

Please read the documentation on the demo xref:demos:trino-taxi-data.adoc[] on how to proceed with the demo.
